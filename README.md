# Weather-App
Using external APIs like OpenWeatherMap API, I developed a website that displays the current weather for any location. Also, I used CSS flexbox to create a responsive, centered card and get access APIs using JavaScript's 'fetch()', and dynamically modified content on the page and background images.
